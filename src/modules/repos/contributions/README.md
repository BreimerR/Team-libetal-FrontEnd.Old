# Contributions
The requirement of contribution is the most important feature of this project. 

## Subject Methods
- Automated 
- Structured

### Automated
This will require the calculation of contribution 
based on known factors in code creation
i.e Code
- Complexity. 
- Lines of Code lCol
- Approximate time required for implementation (man-hours required).
- Base feature utilization on the grand scheme. 
    - i.e In a situation where the project is a chat app how often does one use the video calls. 
      providing a scale of how useful is the feature to the product at hand. 
      
### Structured Approach
Providing an automated method to calculate code might be quite hard given the number of unknown factors. 
But if possible it should be more efficient than this. 
In this design each project must have a set of price regulators and evaluators.

Sample consider this project. 
It will require project management to handle the pricing of the software. 
And determine the input per developers to sustain and maintain the project. 
The platform will provide project managers to sign up and apply as for a role in a provided project. 
The developers are the ones to put it to vote on who they require in the team, and their capacity to support the manager. 
Managers. Since this is a collaboration platform payments are not based on fixed salaries but rather. 
Developer input.

Now given this is a contribution platform the developers contribution will be calculated from 
man-hours/total man hours
